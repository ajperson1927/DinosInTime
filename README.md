# DinosInTime
 This is a game created for the Brackeys game jam 2020.2. It it made with the Unity game engine and C#.
 
 The game is a simple platformer, but you have to make it through the level twice. The first time is played by yourself. The second time is your actions played in reverse. You have to think and strategize in order to complete each level.
 
 The biggest challenge in this was creating a dynamic input system that could be used by the player and by the computer, while being open enough to extend it to be used to show a visual representation of the player and computer movements.
